# CreditCardFraudDetection

A classifier model using XGBoost Classifier to figure out whether the transaction is valid or fraud, achieved an accuracy above 99%. 
Worked on â€“
1. EDA - Deleted and Created new features to improve accuracy. 
  Initial features : type, nameOrig, nameDest, Amount, oldbalanceOrig, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest, isFraud, isFlaggedFraud.
  After Analysis: amount, oldbalanceOrg,	newbalanceOrig,	oldbalanceDest,	newbalanceDest,	isFraud,	type_OTHER,	type_TRANSFER,	errorbalanceOrg,	errorbalanceDest,	HourOfTheDay
2. Different models like Decision Trees, Random Forrest, XGBoost and AdaBoost. 
3. Various Performance metrics like confusion matrix, ROC curve, log loss to evaluate the model
